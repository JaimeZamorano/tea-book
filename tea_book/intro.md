# Técnicas Experimentales en Astrofísica 

This is a sequence of lectures on processing astronomical observations using Python programming, written by Jaime Zamorano, Nicolás cardiel, Segio Pascual and Jesús Gallego. 

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
